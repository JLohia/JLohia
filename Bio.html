    <!-- The Journey  -->
    <h2>The Journey</h2>
    <p>SJ Rawla is a British Punjabi hood artist from North East London. Drawing inspiration from the vibrant grime scene of the UK, Desi culture, and personal experiences, his love for music was deeply influenced by his family roots. His grandfather was a Punjabi artist, and his mother is Bubbley Kaur from the band Cornershop. Seven years ago, equipped with a MacBook Pro and self-taught skills from YouTube, SJ began creating music at home. His raw, authentic style reflects his passion for storytelling and his desire to create music that resonates with a broad audience.
